# Environments
Environments are pieces of code that corresponds to a local zone, for example:  
```luau
-- Currently we are at the global environment.
do -- special keyword that lets us create new environments
  -- here it's a local environment
  do
    -- another local environment, now sub the first one
  end
end
-- back to global
```
As we saw, local environments start with a keyword and end with the ```end``` keyword; that keyword closes the environment.  
We use environments to have variables a limited view to other pieces of code, when you are defining a variable inside a local zone they will not be accesible outside itself.  

Before going to define a local variable we first need to use the local keyword, this safely defines a variable inside a local zone (it's better to define all variables using this new keyword, no matter if it's global or not, it really helps you not making errors).  
Common examples:
```luau
var1 = 3 -- This variable is accesible anywhere in the script, it's located inside the global environment.
do
  var2 = 4 -- local var
  do
    var3 = 6 -- var2 and var1 are still accesible
  end
  -- var 3 is not accesible
  do
    var3 = 8 -- since var3 is not accessible here, by being another local environment you can define a variable with the same name.
  end
end
-- Around here the local variables won't be accesible (var 2 & var3)
```
This is used for organizing code and not write the same variable names again.
