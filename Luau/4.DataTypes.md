# Now let's talk about the many hundred types a variable can be
A variable can have multiple data types such as numbers (0-9+), strings ("message") and much more where in the future you could also create one by yourself!  
Let's learn about the most popular data types:  
## Number
This is as simple it gets, it's defined by any number you want and how big the machine can handle.  
You can always use different bases, for example:  
```luau
num1 = 9 --decimal
num2 = 0xF --hexadecimal (15 in decimal)
num3 = 0b11 --binary (4 in decimal)
```
These numbers with different bases all means the same, just that Roblox converts your base into decimal before you can print it in the runtime.  
## String
This is all just a series of characters, it's defined by wrapping " & " from both ends, a string can contain nothing, for example: "".  
There are many ways to define a string, for example you can also use ' & ' instead of the "", this basically lets you put "" inside the string wihout confusing Roblox.  
Another very usefull one is the multiline: ```[[ msg ]]``` this lets you put multiple lines directly.  
### Speaking of multilines did you knew tabs and new lines are actually a character?  
Roblox supports those special characters by putting \ and an indentifier for example: 
```luau
print("Hello\nWorld!") -- \n the escape character, this just puts a new line
```
Expected output:
```
Hello
World!
```
Here is a table containing all these special characters, in the future they will be usefull for work:   

| Escape | Meaning | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| `\n` | New line | `"Hello\nWorld"` |
| `\t` | Tab | `"A\tB"` |
| `\r` | Carriage return | `"Hello\rWorld"` |
| `\b` | Backspace | `"AB\bC"` |
| `\f` | Form feed | `"A\fB"` |
| `\v` | Vertical tab | `"A\vB"` |
| `\"` | Double quote | `"He said \"Hi\""` |
| `\'` | Single quote | `'It\'s fine'` |
| `\\` | Backslash | `"C:\\Folder"` |
| `\ddd` | Decimal ASCII byte (1–3 digits) | `"\65"` → `A` |
| `\xhh` | Hex ASCII byte | `"\x41"` → `A` |

# Booleans
Booleans are just True and False, no in between.  
They are usefull if you want to use the "if statements" in your code, more in the future.  
You define them by giving either ```true``` or ```false``` to your variable, for example:  
```luau
bool1 = true
print(bool1)
bool2 = false
print(bool2)
```
Expected output:  
```
true
false
```
