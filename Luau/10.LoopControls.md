# Loop controls keywords
You have 2 types of keywords that lets you control loops efficiently in a readable way, so lets get started.  
## 1.break
This is used when you want to stop the current loop completely, for example:  
```luau
for i = 1, 100 do -- big loop
    if i > 5 then
        break -- stop when i is bigger than 5
    end
    print(i)
end
```
Expected output:
```
1
2
3
4
5
```
As you can see this is an easy and clean way to stop the loop from executing.  
## 2.continue
This is used when you want to skip the current iteration whenever you want, for example:  
```luau
for i = 1, 5 do
    if i == 3 then
        continue
    end
    print(i)
end
```
Expected output:  
```
1
2
4
5
```
As you can see, it starts by checking if i equals 3, then it skips the whole iteration.
