# Tables

Tables are **the most important data structure** in Luau.  
They are **flexible**, combining arrays, dictionaries, and objects in one.  

Think of a table as a **container for data**, where each value is stored with a **key**.  
This lets you do complex operations for better algorithms.  

You can define a table by using the curvy brackets: 
```luau
local t = {} -- empty table
```

So lets get tough all types of table that we can get:
## 1.Arrays
Arrays are lists of keys that points to a corresponding value, for example: 
```luau
local t = {
    3,
    2,
    1,
    4
}
```
Each value is separated by a ```,``` and they don't require a key to be defined.  

You can access it values by index:  
```luau
t[1] -- 3
t[2] -- 2
t[3] -- 1
t[4] -- 4
t[5] -- nil (value does not exists)
```

## 2.Dictionary
Dictionaries are tables where you can access the values with specific keys, for example: 
```luau
local t = {
    [1] = "Hello",
    ["second"] = ",",
    world = "World", -- if you want a key to be a string you are not obligated to put the square brackets.
    [-999] = "!",
    done = true
}
```

You access them by key:
```luau
t[1] -- "Hello"
t["second"] -- ","
t.world -- "World", same here since it's a string you can use the dot to access the values (preferred)
t[-999] -- "!"
```

## 3.Ordinate tables
These are all just dictionaries, but the values are defined by a word and the values are accessed by a dot, for example: 
```luau
local t = {
    food = "apple",
    rank = "bronze",
    city = "London"
}

t.food = "pizza" -- changes t["food"] into "pizza"
t.rank -- "bronze"
```
---
Remember that you can always print who tables, for example:  
```luau
print(t)
```
Expected output: 
```
{
    ["city"] = "London",
    ["food"] = "apple",
    ["rank"] = "bronze"
}
```
---
In case you don't want a value then you can set it to nil, and it will disappear, for example:  
```luau
local t = {3, 5, 1, 4}

t[4] = nil -- now t[4] will have no value
t[2] = nil

print(t)
```
Expected output:  
```
{
    [1] = 3,
    [2] = nil
    [3] = 1
}
```
Both ```t[2]``` and ```t[4]``` doesn't exists anymore.
