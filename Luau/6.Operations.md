Finally we are at an important page or Roblox scripting, operations.  
There are many type of operations that focuses on which data type you're doing the operation, lets talk about them all.  

| Operation Type       | Operator | Example                  | Description |
|---------------------|----------|--------------------------|-------------|
| **Arithmetic**       | `+`      | `5 + 3`                  | Addition |
|                     | `-`      | `5 - 3`                  | Subtraction |
|                     | `*`      | `5 * 3`                  | Multiplication |
|                     | `/`      | `5 / 2`                  | Division (always float) |
|                     | `^`      | `2 ^ 3`                  | Exponentiation (power) |
|                     | `%`      | `5 % 3`                  | Modulo (remainder) |
|                     | `-`      | `-5`                     | Unary minus (negation) |
| **Comparison**       | `==`     | `5 == 5`                 | Equal to |
|                     | `~=`     | `5 ~= 3`                 | Not equal to |
|                     | `<`      | `3 < 5`                  | Less than |
|                     | `>`      | `5 > 3`                  | Greater than |
|                     | `<=`     | `3 <= 5`                 | Less than or equal |
|                     | `>=`     | `5 >= 3`                 | Greater than or equal |
| **Logical**          | `and`    | `true and false`         | Returns true if both are true |
|                     | `or`     | `true or false`          | Returns true if at least one is true |
|                     | `not`    | `not true`               | Negates a boolean |
| **Concatenation**    | `..`     | `"Hello" .. " World"`    | Joins strings together |
| **Length**           | `#`      | `#table` / `#"text"`     | Returns number of elements in table or length of string |
| **Assignment**       | `=`      | `x = 5`                  | Assigns value to a variable |
|                     | `+=`     | `x += 3`                 | Add and assign (Luau supports) |
|                     | `-=`     | `x -= 3`                 | Subtract and assign |
|                     | `*=`     | `x *= 2`                 | Multiply and assign |
|                     | `/=`     | `x /= 2`                 | Divide and assign |
|                     | `..=`    | `text ..= "!"`           | Concatenate and assign |
