# Nested tables
Nested tables allows you to create tables of any dimensions, by logic it should result like this:  
```luau
local t = {
  {0, 0, 0},
  {0, 0, 0},
  {0, 0, 0},
}
```
And then you can access any values by using ```t[y][x]``` y being the rows and x the column, this works because t[y] gives the table you wanted and with that same table you're accessing the x index.  
You can always add more tables inside the columns, but for higer dimensions i reccomend using a simple algorith.  

# Getting how many elements does a table has
If you want to know how many values does a table have then you can use the ```#``` keyword before putting the table variable, for example:  
```luau
local t = {3, 1, 2}
print(#t)
print({}) -- empty table
```
Expected output:
```
3
0
```
