# Nested tables
Nested tables allows you to create tables of any dimensions, by logic it should result like this:  
```luau
local t = {
  {0, 0, 0},
  {0, 0, 0},
  {0, 0, 0},
}
```
And then you can access any values by using ```t[y][x]``` y being the rows and x the column, this works because t[y] gives the table you wanted and with that same table you're accessing the x index.
