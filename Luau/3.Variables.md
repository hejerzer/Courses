# Variables
Now this is where it gets spicy, variables are values stored inside an identifier, for example: im storing 3 inside the identifier **"val"**.  
Before we can use them, we first need to define them:  
```luau
VariableName = 3
```
As you can see here im defining a variable called **"VariableName"** and giving the value 3, a number.  
Remember a variable can store whatever you want, from numbers to strings and many more!  

## So, why do we use variables?
Variables are a fundamental part of scripting that let you store data, reuse values, and change information while the game is running. Without variables, your code would be static, repetitive, and extremely hard to manage.  
For example:  
```luau
print("Hello")
print("Hello")
print("Hello")
```
As you can see here im repeating the string ```"Hello"``` 3 times, this looks really repetitive so lets create a variable that stores that string:  
```luau
var = "Hello"
print(var)
print(var)
print(var)
```
Much better, by doing this i don't need to repeat that script again and again.   

⚠️**WARNING** You shouldn't define a variable name that Roblox is already using, this confuses the system and ends with trowing an error.  
---
Now, lets change a variable value during runtime: 
```luau
var = "How are you?"
print(var)
var = "I'm good!"
print(var)
```
Expected output:
```
How are you?
I'm good!
```
With this we can finally add some logic to our game, so lets make a simple way to store an old variable that has already changed.
```luau
var = 3
old_var = var --You can also define a variable value by another variable, this will now have the same value as "var".
print(var)
var = 2
print(var, old_var) --You can put multiple things to output directly, those are separated by a ",".
```
Expected output:
```
3
2 3
```
