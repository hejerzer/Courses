# Before starting we need to know how a script works.  
A script is a piece of code that (if enabled) it will execute in the runtime, inside you can write whatever you want and Roblox Studio will try to handle it, but make sure it works because if not, it will trow an error and stop execution.  
# Server Scripts
There are many types of scripts, but we are starting with the most usefull and the most simple one, Server Script.  
As the name suggests, this one runs on the Server side, meaning it will use the server resources and the effects will be replicated at any player (clients).  
Before we actually start coding we need to know where can we put the server scripts, cause these can't run anywhere:  

| Location            | Can ServerScript Run? | Why put it here? |
|---------------------|-----------------------|----------------------------|
| ServerScriptService | ✅ Yes (Recommended)  | This is the safest place for ServerScripts. Scripts here only run on the server and are completely inaccessible to clients, preventing exploits and cheating. |
| Workspace           | ⚠️ Yes (Not Ideal)    | ServerScripts can run here, but objects in Workspace replicate to clients. This can expose logic or create security risks if not handled carefully. |
| ServerStorage       | ⚠️ Yes (Limited Use)  | Scripts can run here, but ServerStorage is mainly for storing assets. It’s better to keep logic in ServerScriptService for clarity and organization. |
| ReplicatedStorage   | ❌ No                 | ServerScripts do not run here. This service is shared with clients and is intended for modules and assets used by both server and client. |
| StarterPlayer       | ❌ No                 | Scripts placed here are copied to the player as LocalScripts. ServerScripts will not execute. |
| StarterCharacterScripts | ❌ No             | This location is for LocalScripts that control player characters. ServerScripts cannot run here. |
| StarterGui          | ❌ No                 | StarterGui is client-only. ServerScripts do not execute here and should never be placed in UI-related services. |

To start, let's create a script inside ServerScriptService by clicking the + button and search for ```Script```
