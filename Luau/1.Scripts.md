# Before starting we need to know how a script works.  
A script is a piece of code that (if enabled) it will execute in the runtime, inside you can write whatever you want and Roblox Studio will try to run it, but make sure it works because it will trow an error and stop execution.  
# Server Scripts
There are many types of scripts, but we are starting with the most usefull and the most simple one, Server Script.  
As the name suggests, this one runs on the Server side, meaning it will use the server resources and the effects will be replicated at any player (clients).
