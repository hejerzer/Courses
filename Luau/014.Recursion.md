# Recursion
Recursion it's a function that solves a problem by breaking it into smaller version of it or loops infinitely.  
Normally you see this type of recursion in factorial numbers, for example:  
```
5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120
```
As you can see in this problem, the problem breaks down into smaller fragments.  
We know that functions can return variables, as the function itself, if we put a stop index (in this case it's 0) and we recursively return and call the function itself with a decremented variable then it will recursively step down, eventually solving the problem.  

Here is a example:  
```luau
local function factorial(x)
    if x == 0 then -- Here the function will finish
        return 1
    else
        return factorial(x - 1) -- the function will call itself recursively, but only when x - 1 = 0 it will stop
    end
end

print(factorial(5))
```
Expected output:
```
120
```
This Works because it acts like a stair case:
```
5 * factorial(4)
5 * (4 * factorial(3))
5 * (4 * (3 * factorial(2)))
...
```
Until:
```luau
factorial(0) == 1
```
Then everything collapses backward like dominoes stacking themselves neatly.  
Another example we can use recursion is with Fibonacci where:
```luau
F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)
```
This will return the last 2 numbers added together of the sequence it formed by recursion.  
But don't be easy with this new find because many recursive functions can grow quite large and slow down the server.  
Here is the Fibonacci sequence in Luau:  
```luau
local function Fib(n)
    if n <= 1 then
        return n
    else
        return Fib(n - 1) + Fig(n - 2)
    end
end
```
