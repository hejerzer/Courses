# Loops
Loops allow you to **repeat code** while a condition is true or for a fixed number of iterations.  
They are essential for iterating over numbers, tables, players, instances, and for running logic over time.  

## 1.Numeric (for) Loop
Lets start with the ```for``` keyword, this is the most useful out of the other loops.  
One way to use this loop is to input a variable, an end and the increment, for example:  
```luau
for i = 1, 10, 2 do -- start from 1 (i or index), end at 10 and increment by 2 for each iteration.
    print(i) -- you can use the variable i inside this environment
    -- end of iteration
end
```
Expected output:
```
1
3
5
7
9
```
It doesn't ends at 10 because it would go outbound.  
By default the increment value is 1, so you can rewrite as:  
```luau
for i = 0, 5 do
    print(i)
end
```
Expected output:
```
1
2
3
4
5
```

Always remember, if the increment is opposite to the target the loop won't run:  
```luau
for i = 1, 5, -1 do -- increment by -1
    print(i)
end

for i = 1, -5, -1 do
    print(i)
end
```
Expected output:
```
1
0
-1
-2
-3
-4
-5
```
As we saw only the second loop actually runs, this is a well known silent killer for you scripts, so you should take more attention to loops.  

## 2.While loop
This loop is used when you don't know how many iterations you are needed, so it runs until a condition is specified.  
Example: 
```luau
while true do
    print("!")
    wait(1) -- waits each second, needed so it doesn't crashes
end
```
Expected output:
```
!
!
!
!
and from here is goes on infinitely
```
⚠️**WARNING** Running such infinite loops without ending them or giving some time between iterations can cause the script to crash.  

We can always tell when to stop, by setting the condition to false or nil, but it requires a variable to be declared.  
Example:
```luau
local boolean = true
while boolean do -- true so it runs
    print(2)
    boolean = false -- sets to false, now in the next iteration the loop will stop.
end
```
Expected output:
```
2
```
⚠️**WARNING** Roblox runs scripts instruction by instruction, if you put an infinite loop at the start, the rest will wait until it's finished, in this case never.
```luau
while true do
    wait(1)
end

print("Hello, World!")
```
Expected output:
```
```
In this case the print function never ran.

## 3.Repeat until loops
This type of loop runs at least once, then checks the condition.
For example:  
```luau
local x = 0
-- x starts at 0
repeat
    x += 1 -- increment itself with 1
    print(x)
until x == 5 -- stop when x equals 5
```
Expected output:
```
1
2
3
4
5
```
