We have already talked about functions and we have already passed the basic levels.  
Functions are a method of repeating section of code, but with some tweaks.

# Basic functions
Basic functions just let you repeat pieces of code so you don't have to write that again.  
By first you need to define a function, which is not the exact same as declaring a variable:
```luau
local function SayHi() -- the () are not important now
  -- local scope
  print("Hi")
end
```
And with this you got a function, but it's not done yet, if you want to execute it contents you need to call it:
```luau
SayHi()
SayHi()
SayHi()
```
By putting the ```()``` after the function name you're basically calling it so now it will execute whatever is inside that function.  
Expected output:
```
Hi
Hi
Hi
```
If you dont call a function, then that is just a basic variable.
```luau
-- alternative method of defining a function (not reccomended)
MyFunction = function()
  local i = 3
  i += 10
  print(i)
end

MyFunction = 3
MyFunction() -- MyFunction became 3, so now you can't call it anymore because it is not a function anymore
```
Expected output:
```
ERROR: Attempted to call a number value
```

# Detailed functions
Another and more usefull way of using function is to give them an input and get an output, those 2 brackets are used to not only call a function but to also give parameters (input) into the function, for example:
```luau
local function MyFunction(a, b) -- Acts like a table but it actually isn't
  -- You declared 2 new parameters, these are variables that waits to get defined when calling the function
  print(a, b)
end

MyFunction(3, 1) -- Now you're calling the function where: a = 3 and b = 1
```
Expected output:
```
3 1
```
Now, what if i want to put as many parameters as i want but i don't know how many of them am i gonna put, you will use the ```...``` parameter, this means it stores as many parameters you want (like a table), but it does not acts like that.
```luau
local function MyFunction(a, ...) -- a is the first parameter and then it accepts as many you want
  print(a, ...) -- printing ... will give out all parameters that it is hiding
end

MyFunction(3, 1, 4, 1)
MyFunction(2)
MyFunction(3, 6, 1, 5, 1, 6)
MyFunction()
```
Expected output:
```
3 1 4 1 
2 
3 6 1 5 1 6
nil (a does not exists)
```
When i told you that those 3 dots doesn't acts like a table, you just need to wrap it into a table:
```luau
local function x(...)
  local parameters = {...}
  print(parameters[2], #parameters)
end

x(3, 1, 5)
```
Expected output:
```
1 3
```
---
Now we have talked about the input and the context of the function, but what about the output?  
You can use functions to return values, kinda like a machine, you give some wheat and it turns it into bread, then it gives back to you.  
You can return values using the ```return``` keyword, when Roblox runs instruction, the function immedially stops, this allows some better organization into your code.  
You can return values by placing them after the return keyword, kinda like: ```return apples, banana, pineapple```, here's an example:  
```luau
local function x(a)
  if a > 6 then
    return -- if n is bigger than 6 then it ends executing the function and returns nil
  end
  return a + 1 -- returns the operation a + 1
end

local y = x(3) -- the variable y picks up the returned value, in this case 4
local z = x(10) -- the variable z becomes nil
```

# Functions inside tables
You can put functions inside tables so it allows you to develope complex operations, this one is quite tricky but heres an example:  
```luau
local t = {}
function t.MyFunction()
  print("Hi")
end
```
❗**NOTE** I didn't added the local keyword because it directly depends on the table you're defining the function.

When it comes with functions, this is all i have for now, note that we are not completed yet.
