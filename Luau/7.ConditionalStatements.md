# Decision making
Conditional statements are separated in 2 categories: code execution and variable conditions, so lets start with the first one:  
By using the ```if```, ```else``` and the ```elseif``` keywords we are able to execute code with a condition.  
## How does this works?  
The code will execute just how you expressed your conditions, it requires a true boolean or an "exists" input to execute code inside the statement, for example:  
```luau
local var = 3
if var > 2 then -- var > 2 results in true, so this piece of code will run
  -- now we are inside local environment!!!
  print(var)
else
  print("Var is less or equal than 2")
end
```
Expected output:
```
3
```
Another example:
```luau
local condition = false or true -- condition will become true
if not condition then -- uses the "not" keyword, this just invers the boolean, remember, the code under it will execute if the statement is true or exists
  print("no")
else
  print("yes")
end
```
Expected output:
```
yes
```
Another example:
```luau
local num = 6
if num < 2 then
  print("num is less than 2")
elseif num > 10 then
  print("num is bigger than 10")
elseif num > 8 then -- since we already checked if the num is bigger than 10, this time it cannot be bigger
  print("num is bigger than 8 and less than 10")
else
  print("num is in range of 2 and 8")
end
```
Expected output:
```
num is in range of 2 and 8
```
You can also use "conditions of existence" for triggering an ```if``` statement, for example:  
```luau
if 3 then -- anything that isn't false or nil will automatically become true
  print(3)
else
  print(nil)
end
```
Expected output:  
```
3
```
