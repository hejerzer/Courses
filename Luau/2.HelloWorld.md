# The first script you will ever create, Hello, World!
Of course it's not a course if we are not starting without a simple hello world programm!  
So before actually telling roblox how to print we need to first learn about the function ```Print(...)```.  
This is a simple function already included into luau that lets you say something in the console, as starting i will not stress you about advanced features (functions) so let's learn what this does.  

> Print("Hello, World!")
