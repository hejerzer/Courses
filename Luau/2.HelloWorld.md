# The first script you will ever create, Hello, World!
Of course it's not a course if we are not starting without a simple hello world programm!  
So before actually telling roblox how to print we need to first learn about the function ```Print(...)```.  
This is a simple function already included into luau that lets you say something in the console.
> As starting i will not stress you about advanced features (functions) so let's learn what this does.  

```lua 
Print("Hello, World!")
```   

This is the simplest a script could be, what this does it printing ```Hello, World!``` to the console, so let me explain in a more detailed way.  
- **Print** - This is the name of the function.
- **( & )** - These is how you call the function, we are not there yet.
- **"Hello, World!"** - This is the message.

As you noticed inside the message i've included the " & " around the message, this is a string, which we will learn more aobut later, it lets you store a series of characters.  

And thats all! The simplest script you can make as of now.
