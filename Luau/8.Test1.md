Before we got any more advanced, it's great to take a simple test, remember that we are still not close until we can finally use this programming language to it's full potential.  

# Question 1: Variables

Which of the following is the correct way to define a local variable in Luau?

a) `var x = 10`  
b) `local x = 10`  
c) `x := 10`  
d) `int x = 10`

# Question 2: Data Types

What is the type of the value returned by this expression?
```luau
print(type("Roblox"))
```
a) number  
b) string  
c) boolean  
d) nil

# Question 3: Operations
What will be the value of result after this code runs?

```luau
local a = 5
local b = 3
local result = a ^ b  
```

a) 8  
b) 15  
c) 125  
d) 53

# Question 4: Conditional Statements
What will be printed when this code executes?

```luau
local score = 75

if score >= 90 then
    print("A")
elseif score >= 80 then
    print("B")
elseif score >= 70 then
    print("C")
else
    print("F")
end
```

a) A  
b) B
